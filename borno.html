        How many states are in Nigeria Actually, Nigeria has 36 states and one
        federal capital territory. Between 1960 and 1963, Nigeria was only
        divided into 3 regions. They were called eastern region, western region
        and northern region. From 1963 to 1967, Nigeria had 4 regions instead of
        three because of the carving out of the mid western region out of the
        old western region. Then, between 1967 and 1975, General Yakubu Gowon
        created the first 12 states in Nigeria. They were Rivers, Cross Rivers,
        East Central State( all from the old eastern state), Bendel, Western
        State and Lagos( all 3 from the old western state), Benue-Plateau,
        Kaduna, Kwara, Kano, Northwestern State and North-Eastern State (all
        from the old northern region). Abuja was created from the old Niger
        State (1976 - 1987). List of state in Nigeria increased to 19. In 1991
        this number became even larger - 21. Finally, 36 states and capitals
        were recorded in Nigeria in 1996.
